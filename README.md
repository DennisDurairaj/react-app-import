### Comments

After delving deeper into React, when I looked back at my first implementation of the task I was slightly disappointed by it realising I have done things in a slightly unorthodox manner. This implementation is much more cleaner and done in the react way, not overloading the components with various states for every small hide/show.
I have also used es2015 in this implementation.
The components are divided nicely and are meaningful. The form validation code is imported from a separate javascript file as well.
